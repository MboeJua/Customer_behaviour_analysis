### Customer_behaviour_analysis

# Project Aim
* This study is based on a marketing campaigns. As we were out to understand the customer behavior to aid us 
create better and more impactful campaigns.

# Data Processing and Cleaning
* Following data collections, we assembled both structured and unstructured data using R-Studio. 
* We carried out data manipulations to adjust for entry problems, cleanings for duplicate,creation of new variables and much more

# Exploratory Analysis
* This exploratory analysis, to help us understand our data and if there's a need for standardization. Also, this help us identify relevant variables for our model building.
* This was done using correlation plots, box plots, histograms and barplots.

# Modeling
* Our data was split into training and test data on ratio 80:20 respectively
* In our model buidling, Linear regression, Regression tree, Random Forest Machinel learning techniques were applied.
* Influential points were analyzed
* RMSE and Mape score were calculated for model accuracy on our test data.

# Conclusion
* We realized Regression Tree had the best accuracy and was later on used in our report to management.

# We acknowledge other methods which could lead to better accuracy, but we ommited them given the complexity it requires and not easy to interpret for non data oriented individuals
