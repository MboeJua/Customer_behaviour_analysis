## Customer_behaviour_analysis

# This study is based on a marketing campaigns. As we were out to understand the customer behavior to aid us 
# create better and more impactful campaigns.

# Following data collections, we assembled both structured and unstructured data using R-Studio. 
# We carried out data manipulations to adjust for entry problems, cleanings for duplicate,creation of new variables and much more
# This was followed by exploratory analysis to help us understand our data and if there's a need for standardization. 
# Also, this help us identify relevant variables for our model building.
# In our model buidling, Linear regression, Regression tree, Random Forest Machinel learning techniques were applied.
# RMSE and Mape score were calculated for model accuracy on our test data.

# We realized Regression Tree had the best accuracy and was later on used in our report to management.

# We acknowledge other methods which could lead to better accuracy, but we ommited them given the complexity it requires and not easy to interpret for non data oriented individuals
